%description
This package allows you to publish the state of a robot to tf. Once the state
gets published, it is available to all components in the system that also use
tf. The package takes the joint angles of the robot as input and publishes the
3D poses of the robot links, using a kinematic tree model of the robot. The
package can both be used as a library and as a ROS node. This package has been
well tested and the code is stable. No major changes are planned in the near
future
